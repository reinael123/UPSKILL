**VERY IMPORTANT difference from `print`:**

|`print`|`return`|
|---|---|
|Only shows the value on screen|Sends the value back to be used|
|Does NOT stop the function|Stops the function|
|Cannot be stored in a variable|Can be stored and used later|
### **Return Statement (Simple Summary)**

- `return` sends a value **out** of the function.
    
- It **stops** the function immediately.
    
- You can **store** the returned value in a variable to use it later.
    
- `print` only shows the value; `return` gives you the value.
    

**Easy way to remember:**

> `return` = "Here's your answer, catch it!"
