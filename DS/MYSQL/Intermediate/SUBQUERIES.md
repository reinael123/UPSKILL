fquerry sa loob ng querry


```
select *
from employee_demographics
WHERE employee_id IN 
					(SELECT employee_id
						FROM employee_salary
						WHERE dept_id = 1 )
;

```

using subquerries with [[WHERE statement]]

```
select avg(max_age), avg(min_age), avg(count_age)
from
(select gender, 
avg(age) as avg_age,
max(age) as max_age,
min(age) as min_age, 
count(age) as count_age
from employee_demographics
group by gender) as agg_table
;

```
in this code we used [[GROUP BY statement]] kung san merong select table sa loob ng select table para ma output yung average ng average na kinuha natin sa loob ng unang select
