**The 5 Whys**
When analyzing data, you’ll find a problem and need to understand why. The [5 Whys(opens in a new tab)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys) is a valuable technique in problem solving that is easy to remember. You can determine the root cause of a problem by **asking the question "Why?" five times**. 

First ask a "Why?" question, get an answer, and then ask a second "Why?" question. And so on! Each answer will inform your next "Why?" question. The answer to the fifth "Why?" should reveal the root cause of the problem.

So just ask Why 5 times to get the root problem

Data analysis vs Data science

- **Data analysts** collect and examine large data sets to identify trends, forecasts, and data visualizations to tell a compelling story through actionable insights. These insights help businesses make informed decisions about business needs.
- **Data scientists** design and create new processes for data modeling. They use algorithms, predictive analytics, and statistical analysis. Data scientists have technical skills to arrange unstructured data and build their own methodologies to make predictions based on data trends.

3 classic Data Science methodologies:
- Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)
- Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD)
- Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess (SEMMA).
they are best for:
- Use data mining methods
- Are best suited for structured data
- Are useful for using descriptive and predictive analytics
- Share some common activities, such as data gathering, data transformation, data modeling, and model evaluation
- Structured Data

Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)

![[Pasted image 20250416165640.png]]

1. Business understanding
2. Data understanding
3. Data preparation
4. Modeling
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

It starts with Business understanding, it is the most famous approaches for data science projects

Knowledge Discovery in Database (KDD)

![[Pasted image 20250416165838.png]]

1. Selection
2. Preprocessing
3. Transformation
4. Data Mining
5. Interpretation/Evaluation

KDD helps businesses understand customer behavior and predict future trends. It's a repeating process, so new data can improve results. But it doesn’t cover modern data issues like big data tools, ethics, or team roles.

 Sample, Explore, Modify, Model, Assess (SEMMA

![[Pasted image 20250416170120.png]]

1. **S**ample
2. **E**xplore
3. **M**odify
4. **M**odel
5. **A**ssess

SEMMA is a method that turns data into useful knowledge. It helps with business problems like fraud, customer loyalty, and risk. Made by SAS, it mainly focuses on building models. it's a repeating process that leads to deeper questions over time.
