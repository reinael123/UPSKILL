**Data is critical for business and has big value.** Data is one of the most valuable assets organizations can have, whether in business, finance, healthcare, retail, technology, marketing, or other industries. The number of companies using **data insights** continues to grow. Data insights have the potential to help many companies:

- Improve operations
- Better understand end users or customers
- Drive efficiency

- Reduce costs
- Increase profits
- Find new innovations

Structured Data:
Databases
Formatted File

Unstructured Data:
Audio
Video
Image Data
Documents

**Structured data** is information that can be organized in rows and columns. Perhaps you've seen structured data in a spreadsheet, like Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel. For complex information, data analysts use tools like Structured Query Language (SQL) which can sort through vast amounts of data stored in many connected tables. If you can organize information within data into groups, based on specific characteristics, then those groups are structured data.

**Unstructured data** refers to “everything else”. There is no predefined format. Unstructured data lacks any built-in organization, or structure. It’s a conglomeration of varied types of data that are stored in their original formats.  

Examples of unstructured data include images, texts, social media posts, like tweets, customer comments, medical records, and even song lyrics.

Data analysts spend a lot of time working in a [[Database]]. A database is an organized collection of structured data in a computer system. Think of a database as a container or repository with many columns and rows. A database makes data highly organized, so the data is easily accessible by queries and computation software.

Quantitative data relates to numbers.
- Is also called **numerical data**
- Represents things that can be measured and assigned values
- Can be counted and measured, such as height, weight, length, blood pressure, the temperature outside, and so on

Qualitative data relates to words and descriptions.
- Is also called **categorical data**
- Represents the characteristics, attributes, properties, and qualities of things
- Describes data using language (rather than numbers), such as smell, location, color, texture, marital status, and so on

Summary
- **Quantitative** means something is numerical and you can count it.  Think **quantity** - something you can count (or measure).
- **Qualitative** means something is not numerical and can’t be counted. Think **quality** – something you can categorize about data instead.

- **Quantitative** data can be **discrete** or **continuous**.
- **Qualitative** data can be **nominal** or **ordinal**.

Big Data - digital footprint, can be used to answer new problems by analyzing old data.

5 V's of Big Data


| **Value**    | refers to the ability to turn data into value. The main reasons why people invest time to understand big data is to derive value from it. |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Veracity** | refers to the quality and trustworthiness of data.                                                                                        |
| **Velocity** | refers to the incredible speed at which new data is generated and the speed at which it moves around.                                     |
| **Variety**  | refers to the different types of data to use. (structured or unstructured)                                                                |
| **Volume**   | refers to the vast amounts of data being generated.                                                                                       |

Types of Data Analytics

| **Descriptive analytics**  | What is happening?                      |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Diagnostic analytics**   | Why is it happening?<br>                |
| **Predictive analytics**   | What is likely to happen in the future? |
| **Prescriptive analytics** | What should happen?                     |

1. It’s important for businesses across industries to find insights to potentially improve operations, get a better understanding of customers or end users, increase profits, and much more.
    
2. 2
    
    Data analysis is the process of collecting, cleaning, and transforming data to obtain insights to help make better and informed decisions.
    
3. 3
    
    Structured data can be organized in databases with many columns and rows. Unstructured data lacks organization and can be data such as tweets, customer comments, medical records, and so on.
    
4. 4
    
    Quantitative data means you can count it and it’s numerical. Qualitative data means you can't count it, and it’s not numerical. When you think of qualitative data, think “quality”—something you can categorize about data instead.
    
5. 5
    
    Big data is characterized by the 5 V’s: Volume, Variety, Velocity, Veracity, and Value.
    
6. 6
    
    There are four types of data analytics that answer key questions, build on each other, and increase in complexity:
    
    - Descriptive
    - Diagnostic
    - Predictive
    - Prescriptive
    
7. 7
    
    While there is no single, defined data analysis process, these are the typical steps to follow:
    
    - Collect
    - Clean
    - Analyze
    - Visualize
    
8. 8
    
    A data visualization, such as a chart, graph, or map, helps you explore and interpret data during analysis to identify patterns or trends, communicate results, and help people understand the insights to make decisions.
    
9. 9
    
    One type of visualization can display data in a better way, compared to another type of visualization. The goal is to have a visualization that’s effective, attractive, and impactive.
