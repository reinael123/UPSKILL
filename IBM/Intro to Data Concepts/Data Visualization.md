Types of data comparison

**Relative proportion** is the amount or quantity of a subset present in the population of all data points. For example, if there are 25 students in a class of which 15 are girls and 10 are boys, then the proportion of girls is 15 out of 25 (3 of 5) and the proportion of boys is 10 out of 25 (2 of 5).

**Ranking** is the relationship between a set of items, in which one item is ranked higher, lower, or the same, compared to a second item. For example, video game players can be ranked in order by their highest score in a tournament.

**Time** is a series of data points that are listed or sequenced in time order, such as, for example, the daily time of high tide and low tide at a beach.

**Frequency** is the number of times a certain event occurs. For example, if it snows two times today, then the frequency of snow on this particular day is 2.

A **correlation** is the relationship between two random variables, which are typically related in linear way. For example, there is a correlation between the height of parents and their children.

common types of quantitative charts

1. **Pie charts** are circular, statistical graphics that are divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportions. The total sum of all “slices” must equal 100%. Pie charts are useful for showing the relative proportion for a small number of items. They can very easily show which category is the largest or has the most impact.
	**Example:** A grocery store chain uses a pie chart to show the percentage of total profit from 
	different grocery store locations and highlight the store earning the most profit.
	
2. **Bar charts** are useful for ranking a large number of categories, showing correlation, and using for before-after analysis. Use bar charts for comparison and ranking. Bar charts help illustrate change over time.
	**Example:** An online pharmacy observes a big jump in web traffic during the COVID-19 pandemic, so they use a bar chart to capture month-to-month traffic for one year to make it easier to identify the increase in web traffic.

3. **Column charts** can show relative proportion between items and show data over time and frequency. Column charts display information vertically. They are also useful for showing negative data.
	**Example:** A big-box company tracks the number of accidents that occur in warehouses. When the number of accidents falls below the monthly average, the company uses a column chart to distinguish this in a monthly report.
	
4. **Line charts** can display data over time and frequency; however they typically display this data over a continuum. Line charts can track changes over short and long periods of time. Because of this, line charts are useful for indicating small changes. They are effective in showing trends.
	**Example:** An IT help desk must measure their service performance for closing customer issues, so they use a line graph to track how many chats and emails the team responds to per month.
	
5. **Scatter plot charts** display plotted points to show a relationship between two sets of data. They display a large amount of data and make outliers stand out. Scatter plot charts can also help you identify patterns.
	**Example:** A bank uses a scatter plot chart to explain to executives that a data set of thousands of customer calls reveals that customer happiness levels are highest when call response time is lowest.
