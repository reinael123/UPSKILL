ETL **extract, transform, and load (ETL**)

ETL is a data integration process that combines data from multiple data sources into a single, consistent data store that is loaded into a data warehouse or other target system.

ETL provides the foundation for data analytics and machine learning workstreams. Organizations often use ETL to:

- Extract data from legacy systems
- Cleanse the data to improve data quality and establish consistency
- Load data into a target database
