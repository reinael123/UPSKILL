dividing integer outputs also an integer

numeric - may decimal place

so if dinivide mo integer and numeric, numeric yung output

[^1]: **variance is a measure of how spread out a set of numbers is from their average (mean).**
	
	Think of it like this:
	
	- **Low variance:** The numbers are clustered closely together. They are all pretty similar to the average. Imagine a group of students who all scored very close to 85 on a test.
	    
	- **High variance:** The numbers are more spread out. Some numbers are much higher than the average, and some are much lower. Imagine another group of students where some scored in the 90s, some in the 70s, and some even lower.
	    
	
	**Here's a simple analogy:**
	
	Imagine throwing darts at a dartboard:
	
	- **Low variance:** All your darts land very close to the bullseye.
	- **High variance:** Your darts are scattered all over the board
	

[^2]: **standard deviation is a typical measure of how spread out numbers are from their average.** It's like finding the "average distance" of each number in a dataset from the mean.
	
	Think of it as:
	
	- **A more interpretable version of variance.** Remember that variance squares the differences from the mean, which can make the units hard to understand (e.g., if your data is in meters, the variance is in meters squared).
	- **Putting the spread back into the original units.** Standard deviation takes the square root of the variance, so it's expressed in the same units as your original data. This makes it easier to grasp the actual spread.
	
	**Here's the dartboard analogy again:**
	
	- **Low standard deviation:** Your darts are clustered tightly around the bullseye. The "average distance" of your darts from the center is small.
	- **High standard deviation:** Your darts are scattered all over the board. The "average distance" of your darts from the center is large.
